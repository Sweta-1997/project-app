This is a social media app developed by me that allows users to post interesting events.

Technologies used:- HTML, CSS, MATERIAL UI, Reactjs, Nodejs, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB.

• Created end-to-end web application with rich UI using MERN stack.

• The user can create their own account by signing up into this app.

• The user will be able to create, edit, search and delete their posts by logging in this social
media app.

• HTML5, CSS, Material UI, and ReactJS are used as the front-end tools to
build module pages that communicate with back-end API with Nodejs,
Express, and Mongoose.
